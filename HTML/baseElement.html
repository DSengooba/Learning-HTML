    <h2>The Base element</h2>
    <p><img src="images/smiley.jpg" width="24" height="39" alt="Smiley"> - Notice that we have only specified a
        relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look
        for the image at "https://news.iium.edu.my/?p=111333".</p>

    <p><a href="https://timjspencer.com/the-musicals">The musicals</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window,
        even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to
        "_blank".</p>
