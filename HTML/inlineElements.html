    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">I am coding</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
<p style="color: red;">It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang . It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate</p>
