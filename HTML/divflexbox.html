    <h2>This is div with flexbox example</h2>
    <p>The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure
        without using float or positioning.

        To make the CSS flex method work, surround the div elements with another div element and give it the status as a
        flex container.</p>
