    <h2>The title element</h2>
    <p>The title element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the
        browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

        The title element is required in HTML documents!

        The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by
        search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.</p>
